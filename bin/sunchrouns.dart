//*in  synchronous programming it is in big rules is "step by step"
//In Synchronous programming, the program is executed line by line, one at a time. 
//Synchronous operation means a task that needs to be solved before proceeding to the next one.

// Here in this example, you can see that it will print line by line.
// Letâ€™s suppose Second Big Operation takes 3 seconds to load then Third Operation
// and Last Operation need to wait for 3 seconds. To solve this issue asynchronous programming is here.
